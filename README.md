# Human Resources Data Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves building an interactive and insightful data dashboard using Tableau, leveraging a comprehensive Human Resources dataset. The dashboard is designed to provide a holistic view of hiring, employment trends, and workforce distribution across various dimensions, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features

- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):**
  - **Total Hired**: Displays the total number of employees hired.
  - **Total Active**: Represents the total number of currently active employees.
  - **Total Terminated**: Shows the total number of employees who have left the organization.

- **Line Plots:**
  - **Hired By Year**: Visualizes the trend in hiring over the years.
  - **Terminated By Year**: Tracks the number of terminations across different years.

- **Bar Plots:**
  - **Hires by Department**: Shows the number of employees hired in each department.
  - **Hires by Location**: Displays hiring distribution across different locations.

- **Geo Plot:**
  - **Hired by Location**: A geographical representation of where employees were hired.

- **Pie Plot:**
  - **Hired by Gender**: A breakdown of hiring based on gender distribution.

- **Additional Visualizations**: Several other charts are used to explore additional dimensions of the dataset, such as employee tenure, termination reasons, and performance metrics.

## Objective

The objective of this dashboard is to provide an intuitive interface for analyzing key HR metrics, enabling organizations to:

- Understand trends in hiring and terminations.
